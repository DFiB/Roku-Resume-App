# Roku-Resume-App
An app for Roku that I created while attempting to learn BrightScript and Scene Graph through the roku developer documents found here: https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Roku+SDK+Documentation

Unfortunately, I was not able to get media playback to work or go from one scene to the other but I am currently attempting to add those functionalities as well in order to properly display my background as a content creator through my beginner understanding of BrightScript and SceneGraph.
